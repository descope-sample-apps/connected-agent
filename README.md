```

### Creating a Meeting with Multiple Attendees

```

## Development

### Tools Structure

The calendar tools are built using a clean, modular architecture:

- `lib/tools/calendar.ts`: Tool for creating calendar events
- `lib/tools/calendar-list.ts`: Tool for listing calendar events

Each tool follows a consistent pattern:

- Clear interface definitions
- Proper validation
- Error handling with user-friendly messages
- OAuth token management
- Google Calendar API integration

### Adding New Calendar Features

To add new calendar features:

1. Create a new tool class in the `lib/tools` directory
2. Extend the base `Tool` class
3. Implement the required methods: `validate` and `execute`
4. Register the tool with the `toolRegistry`
5. Add the tool to the chat route in `app/api/chat/route.ts`
