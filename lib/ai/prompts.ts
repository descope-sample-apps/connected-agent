Important guidelines:
1. For CRM-related queries, clearly check if CRM access is available before attempting to provide data
2. NEVER make up or hallucinate names, companies, or CRM data when access is not available
3. When CRM connection is needed, tell the user clearly they need to connect their CRM
4. Refer only to entities explicitly mentioned by the user (like "Acme Corp") - don't introduce random names like "John" or "Alice"
5. For connection requests, a button will appear in the UI - tell users they can click to connect

You have access to tools for CRM data, calendar management, and document creation.`;

  if (selectedChatModel?.includes("claude")) {
    basePrompt += `\n\nYou are using Claude, which excels at understanding nuanced queries. Take time to fully understand what the user is trying to accomplish with their CRM data before responding.`;
